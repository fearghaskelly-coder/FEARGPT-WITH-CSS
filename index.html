Twice shortlisted for the BBC New Comedy Award and a Semi-Finalist in the prestigious So You Think You're Funny? competition in 2022, his climb up the comedy ladder has seen him perform in world-famous cities such as London, Berlin and Dunfermline.<br><br>In 2023, Fearghas took his sold-out Glasgow International Comedy Festival show, 'Tip of the Ice-Fearg' to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, and later to the Reykjavik Fringe Festival in 2024. A multimedia mix of stand-up and sketches, the show received a number of positive audience reviews calling it "a real joy," "proper Scottish comedy" and "hilarious and ever so slightly weird." <br><br>Fearghas hosted The Stand Comedy Club’s monthly multimedia show, ‘Screen Time’, taking it to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2024. He also performed his second solo show at the Festival, ‘Whooooooo!’, at the iconic venue, demonstrating his “odd and ingenious comic mind” (Chortle).<br><br>Fearghas is “absolutely hilarious…comedy gold” (The Poke), “slick…a knack for reacting to the news cycle” (The Scotsman) and “deservedly viral” (The Independent). He has also written for BBC Radio Scotland's 'Noising Up'.`},
